    # Starting from observer version 4.2, the network selection for the observer is based on the 'local_ip' parameter, and the 'devname' parameter is no longer mandatory.

    # If only the 'devname' parameter is set, the observer will use the 'devname' parameter for the configuration.
    # If neither the 'devname' nor the 'local_ip' parameters are set, the 'local_ip' parameter will be automatically assigned the IP address configured above.
